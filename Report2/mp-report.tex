\begin{abstract}
Recurrent Neural Networks are commonly used in natural language translation and also generation. In the recent years, they have shown good performance when applying them to human motion prediction tasks. We are using a LSTM cell as the base of our network to predict 1 second of human motion. We can conclude that a simple network, even with the most optimized parameters, cannot compete in prediction human motion with a state of the art sequence to sequence model.
