\begin{abstract}
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are commonly used nowadays in machine learning applications, starting from natural language processing  as well as image analysis applications, gesture recognition or other deep learning applications. In the recent years, RNNs have shown good performance when applying different RNN architectures also to human motion prediction tasks. In the current work, a state of the art LSTM cell is used as the base of our network to predict human motion poses. We can conclude that a basic LSTM network, with the most optimized parameters performs a very good job, though it cannot compete a state of the art sequence to sequence model when it comes to human motion prediction.
