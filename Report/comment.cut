The authors would like to thank Prof. Dr. Otmar Hilliges for providing the theoretical background needed for this work and his assistants for the skeleton code that allowed us to focus on the more interesting aspects of the task.

The work is carried out in the frame of the lecture "Machine Perception" at ETH Zurich in the spring semester 2018.
