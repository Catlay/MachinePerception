Possible ideas to make it better

1. Do scaling of data ase don mean and std. so data new to be in scale -1 to 1,( x-mean/std)
2. Add gaussian noise in the input, maybe 2-3 times less than the std of real data and 0 mean?
3. Implement the encoder-decoder of friagkiadaki, with step2 and FC networks

4. Regarding tuning htese are my ideas:

1. Config: n_epochs, play wiht this, to be sth more than 2-3
2. Config:  Learning rate, to be sth smaller than 0.003, its importnat hyperparameter
3. Config: Lemgth max of input ot be sth more than 600.
4. Code: Clipping of gradients in the code.

Discussion:
1. Change loss type -> what else? cosine distance
2. Use activity labelling
3. Runs in 10min on local computer - why azure account?
